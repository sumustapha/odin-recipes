    <h2>Fish fingers with a twist!</h2>
    <p> I first learned how to bread fish at the Hotel St. George in Harrogate. 
        You could serve them with chips and tell them it's the best fish and chips you can get outside Yorkshire.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound flounder fillets</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable bouillon powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sunflower oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instruction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean fish fillets and cut into 8 thin pieces. Place on a kitchen towel to dry.</li>
        <li>Place flour and bread crumbs in two separate bowls. 
            Divide bouillon powder and parsley between the 2 bowls and mix to combine.
            Beat eggs with a fork in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip fish into the flour, then into the egg wash, and finally dust lightly in bread crumbs. Place on a plate.</li>
        <li>DHeat sunflower oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Gently add fish to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 
            about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve fillets with parsley and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
